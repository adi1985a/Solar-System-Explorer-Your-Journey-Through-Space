## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack & Requirements

### Core Technologies:
*   **Structure**: HTML5
*   **Styling**: CSS3 (`styles/main.css`)
*   **Interactivity**: JavaScript (ES6+ via `js/main.js`)
*   **Icons**: Font Awesome (v6.x via CDN)
*   **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Orbitron, Roboto)
*   **Video**: HTML5 `<video>` tag, YouTube iframe API

### Requirements:
*   **Web Browser**: Any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge).
*   **Internet Connection**: **Required** to load external resources:
    *   Font Awesome CDN: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css`
    *   Google Fonts (Orbitron, Roboto)
    *   YouTube iframe API (for embedded videos)
*   **Local Assets**:
    *   `styles/main.css` (main stylesheet)
    *   `js/main.js` (main JavaScript file for interactivity)
    *   `videos/home.mp4` (background video for the hero section)
    *   `pictures/` directory containing all images for featured cards (e.g., `webb.jpg`, `mars1.jpg`, `sun1.jpg`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup & Viewing

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with your specific details, or simply download the files into a local folder).*

2.  **Ensure Asset Placement**:
    *   Verify that the `styles/` folder contains `main.css`.
    *   Verify that the `js/` folder contains `main.js`.
    *   Verify that the `videos/` folder contains `home.mp4`.
    *   Ensure the `pictures/` subfolder exists and contains all necessary images (e.g., `webb.jpg`).
    *   Confirm that all paths in `index.html` and `styles/main.css` to these local assets are correct.

3.  **Open in Browser or Host Locally**:
    *   **Directly in Browser**: You can usually open `index.html` directly in your web browser (File > Open File).
    *   **Using a Simple HTTP Server (Recommended for consistent behavior, especially if JavaScript involves fetching local resources or has complex pathing)**:
        If you have Python installed, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        Then, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   Alternatively, use any other local web server solution (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code).

## üí° Website Usage & Navigation

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser (ensure an internet connection for CDN-hosted resources).
2.  **Interface**:
    *   **Navigation Menu**: Use the main navigation (or hamburger menu on mobile) to explore sections like "Home," "Planets," "Stars," "Exploration," "Astronomy," or link to external resources like "NASA Gallery."
    *   **Hero Section**: Watch the autoplaying space video background. Click the "Start Exploring" button to (presumably) scroll to or navigate to the featured content.
    *   **Featured Cards**: Read summaries about recent space discoveries and click links to view external articles.
    *   **Facts Carousel**: View a series of space-related facts, possibly with navigation controls if implemented.
    *   **Video Section**: Click to watch an embedded YouTube video in a modal pop-up. Use buttons to add or remove the video from your "Favorites."
    *   **Footer**: Access quick links, (placeholder) social media profiles, or use the (client-side only) newsletter signup form.
3.  **Actions**:
    *   **Toggle Mobile Menu**: On smaller screens, click the hamburger icon to open and close the navigation menu.
    *   **Manage Favorites**: Click "Add to Favorites" or "Remove from Favorites" buttons associated with videos. These changes will be saved in `localStorage` and persist if you reload the page.
    *   **Video Modal**: Click play/pause controls within the video modal. Click a close button or outside the modal to dismiss it and resume viewing the main page.
    *   Interact with the (placeholder) newsletter form.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

The project is expected to have the following basic file structure:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the homepage, containing all sections and content.
*   `styles/` (subfolder):
    *   `main.css`: The primary custom CSS file for styling layout, responsiveness, and visual elements.
*   `js/` (subfolder):
    *   `main.js`: Custom JavaScript file for general interactivity, video modal, favorites system, facts carousel logic, and mobile menu.
*   `videos/` (subfolder):
    *   `home.mp4`: The background video for the hero section.
*   `pictures/` (subfolder): Contains all images used for featured cards (e.g., `webb.jpg`, `mars1.jpg`, `sun1.jpg`).
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

## üìù Important Notes & Considerations

*   **`js/main.js` Functionality**: This file is crucial and assumed to handle a significant amount of interactivity: mobile menu, video modal, favorites system (localStorage CRUD), facts carousel, and potentially smooth scrolling or other dynamic effects. Its full implementation is key.
*   **Newsletter Form (Client-Side Only)**: The newsletter signup form is currently a frontend element. For actual subscription functionality, it would need to be integrated with a backend service (e.g., via an API call to a mailing list provider or a custom backend script).
*   **Placeholder Links**: External links (e.g., to NASA articles, social media profiles) should be verified and updated if they are placeholders. Internal navigation links to other potential pages also need corresponding HTML files.
*   **Video Optimization**: The background video (`videos/home.mp4`) should be optimized for web delivery (compression, appropriate formats like WebM/MP4) to ensure fast loading and smooth playback.
*   **`localStorage` for Favorites**: This provides user-specific persistence on a single browser. It's not synchronized across devices or browsers and has storage limits.
*   **CORS**: If fetching any data via JavaScript from external APIs (beyond what YouTube iframe API handles itself), ensure the server hosting those APIs supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) or that you are proxying requests if necessary.
*   **Performance**: Heavy use of a background video, multiple external libraries (Font Awesome, Google Fonts), and potentially unoptimized images can impact page load speed. Consider performance optimization techniques.
